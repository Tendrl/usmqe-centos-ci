# CentOS CI Sample

This sample attempts to establish a pattern to use Centos CI with JJB and
python-cicoclient in a clean manner. This is from an actual example we're
using.

Note: If you have more than one host, you probably want to make the host file
into an ansible host file, which is probably easier to manage.
